# journal_wrapped

This project is largely LLM generated slop. It consists of one-off scripts to massage data from my personal journal into the form described in this blog post.

The only interesting thing here are the [prompts in the prompts directory](https://github.com/s3thi/journal_wrapped/tree/main/prompts).
